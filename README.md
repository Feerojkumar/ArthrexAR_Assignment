# ArthrexAR_Assignment
This is a Augmented Reality (AR) Image tracking app which demonstrates creating particle effects overlay on top of an image. The app tracks an image in the scene and projects particles. Here we can use any any sample image of our choice for image tracking. And then Projected interactive art with particles which inherit image characteristics. I have used the beautiful kingfisher bird image for this project.

## Unity Version:
- Unity Editor 2021.3.14f1
* UnityHub 3.5.0
## Dependencies & External Tools:
Make sure you have all the below dependencies setup with this project.
- Java JDK 
- Android SDK
- Android NDK

![External Tools](https://github.com/Feerojkumar/ArthrexAR_Assignment/assets/140662095/9e48d140-be3b-4703-afdd-77599d20a5de)

##  This sample project depends on below Unity packages:
- [AR Foundation] (https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@5.1/manual/index.html) . For this project, AR Foundation Version 4.2.8
* [Google ARCore XR Plug-in on Android] https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arcore@5.1/manual/index.html. FOr this project Version 4.2.8

## How to use these AR Project
- Connect your android device to the system.

- You can build this project directly to any Android device. Once you build and run this app, ArthreX1.0 app will be installed on you device.

- You can test this app by opening the ArthreX1.0 app in your Andoid device. The app start runniing and opens the AR camera and show it to the bird picture used and it will project the particle effects as shown below.

## To build to device, follow the steps below:

- Install Unity 2021.3.14f1 and clone this repository.

- Open the Unity project at the root of this repository.

- Connect your android device.

- Make sure you enable the debugging option enabled on your android device.

- Enable the Developer option enabled.

- Build and run on device

As with any other Unity project, go to Build Settings, select your target platform to Android, and build and run this project. Make sure that, you have all the above dependencies setup before doing this step.

## Approach - Use any image of choice for tracking.
Created an empty sample scene, then added the Add the AR session and AR session Origin components in your scene. It contains a Camera and any GameObject s created from detected features, such as planes or point clouds.

In AR session Origin, Added the ARTrackedIMageManager script. The tracked image manager is a type of trackable manager and performs 2D image tracking.
The tracked image manager creates GameObjects for each detected image in the environment. Before an image can be detected, the manager must be instructed to look for a set of reference images compiled into a reference image library. It only detects images in this library.

In Assets, Created a Folder called MyReferenceLibrary, inside the folder create a Reference image library. The tracked image will be inserted here.

Go to AR session Origin and in the ARTrackedIMageManager, add the referenceImage (sparrow)

Also add the sparrow image to that ReferenceimageOject.

GIve the name to the added image to sparrow. And specify the physical size and check the keep the texture at run time.

## Approach - Project interactive art with particles which inherit image characteristics.

There are various approaches we can follow in order to create the particles which inherit image charachterstics. 
For Example, create particles usine texture sheet animation technique with particle effects, using the sprite renderer etc. For this project, i have used the sprite renderer. 

First took the bird image as a reference to create the particle effects. imported the bird image into the scene. and the convert the image to sprite. We can convert the image to sprite in unity.

#### Importing an image into Unity.

I would like to import only the bird without any background. To eliminate the background colours from the image, in photoshop i removed the RGB value and saved it in a png format and them imported to Unity.

In Unity, I Creted an empty game object and added a sprite renderer to that empty game object, in the project files i named it as sparrow game object.

#### Coverting image into sprite in Unity.

I have selected the imported sparrow.png file in unity and converted into sprite.

#### Create particle effects that inherits from image characterstics

In Unity, Project hierarchy - create a new particle system.
Now play with the particle properties to achieve the particle colours similar to image characterstics.

- Set emission properties:

- Set shape properties:
 
To achieve particles with the bird shape. I changed the shape to sprite renderer and added the sparrow game object.

- Now, Play with particle colours:

- The Output Result:

To generate the particle colours along with the bird shape, just unselct/un check the game object from inspector pane and this will provide the result with bird shape below.
